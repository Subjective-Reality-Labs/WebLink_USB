# WebUI for WebLink
Vanilla JS and a little Sass. Fonts are included so WebLink could be runned offline.

# Usage

Do ``npm install`` or ``yarn install`` to install [parcel](https://parceljs.org/) that is used for packaging.

``npm start`` - to launch a live server at localhost:1234

``npm build`` - will bundle all files in correspondent folders in ./data/www

``npm build-submodule`` - will bundle in ../data/www when using as a submodule from the WebLink project folder.
